// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step in which you identify key requirements needed for the project and investigate setting necessary parameters."
const design = "This is the third step in which you begin designing the software based on your previous planning and defined requirements."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step in which you begin implementing software designs into the project."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step in which you test and further integrate software desgins that you have previously implemented."
const maintain = "This is the final step in which you maintain your code and continue to fix any bugs that occur."
